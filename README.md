-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
When it comes to users needs, the first thing is to discuss with the client what they are looking for in the program/software. The look, functionatily requirements etc, what arew they looking for specifically. Once those conversations are had the creatation of the user stories happens where we look at what the client wants and then prioritizing the work an translate the the requirements into clear concise things for us to into working sprints. 


-How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Before this course, I never really used agile process. Typically it starts with an idea of how I want to design the code and then create the pseudocode and then begin writing the code. If I were ever to work with a team for development, agile would definetly help, making the project much easier to work with. I can probably apply it to when working on code alone as well, breaking up the work into mangable sections instead of writing the bulk of the code all at once. 



-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member I pretty simple, clear communication, being honest when it comes to your cappabilities as well as delivering the work you would say you would complete in the specicified time frame. But also be ok with helping out your team members as well, since when working on a team if one person falls behind the whole team falls behind.
